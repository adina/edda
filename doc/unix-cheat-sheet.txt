Working at the command line
---------------------------

Use Tab for filename completion: start a filename, and then hit <Tab> to
finish it.

Use arrow keys for command line history and editing: up/down arrows will
move you through commands you've run, and left/right arrows (plus backspace
etc.) let you edit those commands.
