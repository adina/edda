Working at the command line
---------------------------

Use Tab for filename completion: start a filename, and then hit <Tab> to
finish it.

Use arrow keys for command line history and editing: up/down arrows will
move you through commands you've run, and left/right arrows (plus backspace
etc.) let you edit those commands.


Enabling access for other people
--------------------------------

**Warning, this is dangerous; the 'root' account has complete control
over your machine!**

You can give other people access to your EC2 machine by setting a password
for the 'root' account::

  %% passwd root

You can also give them access to some or *all* your EC2 machines by
giving them your private key, but this is a really bad idea.

A less dangerous way to do access control is to have them, or you,
create a public/private key pair by doing::

  %% ssh-keygen -t dsa -f new_key

Then add 'new_key.pub' to ``/root/.ssh/authorized_keys``::

  %% cat new_key.pub >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys

and give them the 'new_key' file as their private key to log into this
EC2 machine only.
