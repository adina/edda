Working at the command line
---------------------------

Use Tab for filename completion: start a filename, and then hit <Tab> to
finish it.

Use arrow keys for command line history and editing: up/down arrows will
move you through commands you've run, and left/right arrows (plus backspace
etc.) let you edit those commands.

Looking at text files
---------------------

'head' and 'tail' will display at the first 10 or last 10 lines of a text
file, respectively.  'head -20' will display at the top 20 lines.

'less' will let you page through output.  'q' exits from 'less' before
the end of the file.

Enabling access for other people
--------------------------------

**Warning, this is dangerous; the 'root' account has complete control
over your machine!**

You can give other people access to your EC2 machine by setting a password
for the 'root' account::

  %% passwd root

You can also give them access to some or *all* your EC2 machines by
giving them your private key, but this is a really bad idea.

A less dangerous way to do access control is to have them, or you,
create a public/private key pair by doing::

  %% ssh-keygen -t dsa -f new_key

Then add 'new_key.pub' to ``/root/.ssh/authorized_keys``::

  %% cat new_key.pub >> /root/.ssh/authorized_keys

and give them the 'new_key' file as their private key to log into this
EC2 machine only.

Long running jobs
-----------------

Use 'top' to keep track of what jobs are running on your machine, either
under your current login/connection or from previous ones.  Type 'q' to
quit out of top.

The first column in top is the process ID, or PID.  It's usually a 3-5
digit number.  You can do::

   kill -9 $pid

(replacing $pid with the number) to stop the jobs.
