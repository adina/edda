Getting started with Crunchy and Python
=======================================

We're going to start out in this class using Crunchy, an application
that ties the Python programming language into a nice Web page system.
You'll need to install and run Crunchy, and then load the tutorial;
follow the instructions below to success!

Getting started
===============

First, you'll need to install Crunchy!

Installing Crunchy
------------------

Go and download the Crunchy zip file from the `Crunchy download site
<http://code.google.com/p/crunchy/downloads/list>`__.  The latest
version as of September 2011 is `crunchy v1.1.2
<http://code.google.com/p/crunchy/downloads/detail?name=crunchy1.1.2.zip&can=2&q=>`__.

Save & unpack the zip file somewhere; on your desktop is fine.  It should
create a folder 'crunchy' alongside the zip file.

**On Mac OS X:** find the 'crunchy' folder.  In the crunchy folder,
double click on 'crunchy.py'.  Wait for the IDLE application start.
Once you see a window named 'crunchy.py' open up, click on it (to
bring it into focus) and then go to the 'Run...' menu, and select 'Run
module'.  Your Web browser should now automagically open up into the
Crunchy page -- congrats, if so!  *You do not need to install Python
first; Macs come with Python already installed.*

**On Windows:** you'll need to install Python 2.x from the `Python
downloads site <http://www.python.org/download/>`__; the latest
version right now is `Python 2.7.2
<http://www.python.org/ftp/python/2.7.2/python-2.7.2.msi>`__.  Install
it!  Now, go and download Crunchy, unpack it, open 'crunchy.py', and
run it as above with Mac OS X.

**Ignore this:** If you're a command line aficionado: download crunchy
and just run 'python crunchy.py' at the command line, from within the
crunchy folder.

Playing with Crunchy
--------------------

If you want to, go ahead and read through the Crunchy tutorial.  It's
not necessary, though; you can just go ahead and run through our own
(much shorter) tutorial (next step!)

Running the tutorial
--------------------

OK, now this tutorial should be loaded into Crunchy.

At any Crunchy prompt ('>>>' text box entry), type::

   crunchy._set_site_security('ged.msu.edu', 'trusted')

You should see the response::

   site security set to: trusted

Now, click on `this link
<http://127.0.0.1:8001/remote?url=http%3A%2F%2Fged.msu.edu%2Fangus%2Fbeacon-2011%2Ftutorial-1.html>`__.
If it doesn't work, you'll need to play with the URL (below).

If your Crunchy Web site is *not* running on port 8001, then you can put this
URL into your menu bar after the third slash (``http://127.0.0.1:NNNN/<here>``) of
your Crunchy site::

   remote?url=http%3A%2F%2Fged.msu.edu%2Fangus%2Fbeacon-2011%2Ftutorial-1.html
