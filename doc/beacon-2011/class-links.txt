At the start of class, working alone in or in groups, examine these
code snippets and figure out what they will print out:

---------------------------

At the start of class: working alone or in local groups, examine the
following code examples and (without running them!) predict what they
will print out, and why.

Thursday, October 13th, 2011
----------------------------

For the first 15 minutes, discuss:

  What are the evolutionary and health implications of Neandertal DNA
  in modern, non-African humans?

  How did the investigators come to the conclusion that as much as
  7.4% of Melanesian genomes are derives from Neandertals/Denisovans?

BONUS: If you want to be thoroughly confused, read `this discussion of
scoping rules
<http://stackoverflow.com/questions/291978/short-description-of-python-scoping-rules>`__
-- e.g. see the first answer.

Later in the class, we'll also take a look at this little assembler:

  https://raw.github.com/ctb/edda/master/doc/beacon-2011/week7/assemble.py


Thursday, October 6th, 2011
---------------------------

At the start of class: working in your usual groups, ACROSS
INSTITUTIONS, check out the list of sentences submitted, here:

   http://lyorn.idyll.org/~t/transfer/cse891/sentences.txt

Divide them into categories of easy- vs hard-to-assemble, and (based
on your expertise in sequence assembly) further categorize the "hard"
sentences around the *reason* they'd be hard to assemble.  Think
especially about:

 - short reads
 - single- vs paired-end reads / short-insert vs long insert
 - reverse/forward matching sequences (which we didn't discuss in class...)
 - error prone sequencing

Please put at least one of each category up on a Jot! board specific
to your group (your categories should encompass all the sentences, but
you can use an exemplar of each sequence).  If you disagree on anything,
note that and ask.

Tuesday, October 4th, 2011
--------------------------

At the start of class:

   Working in groups or individually, please come up with a list of
   items you do not like about the course so far, and what (if
   anything) should be changed for each item.  You might touch on some
   or all of these --

       1. programming tutorials
       2. programming HW
       3. programming support
       4. programming handins
       5. in-class group discussions
       6. in-class "global" discussions
       7. in-class presentations
       8. paper topics and discussions of papers
       9. remote interaction
       10. groups and group structure

   and anything else miscellaneous you might have to say.

   Please try to be *inclusive*, that is, synthesize everything the group
   has to say rather than eliminating concerns that aren't universally agreed
   upon.

   Choose one person at each location to be a scribe, write them down,
   and then paste them into `this link
   <https://docs.google.com/spreadsheet/viewform?formkey=dGhMSFdEWWVzVm9pQ0x1cW0wRFZ0ZEE6MQ>`__.
   Anonymous and individual comments and suggestions are also welcome.
   You can submit during class, or after class -- basically any time
   before Wed evening would be good.

Then, let's play... THE ASSEMBLY GAME!

Each group should have a pile of papers, representing different sets
of short-read sequencing data resulting from feeding the same set of
English quotes into a woodchipper.  The papers contain reads randomly
chosen from the quotes; some are in paired-end form, where the '...'
represents missing text of unknown (but generally consistent...)
length.

Your goal(s)?  Using only pen(cil) and paper -- no Google! --

   1. Identify the total number of source quotes.

   2. Determine the true source text of all the quotes.

This is known as the assembly problem in sequence analysis.

Also, develop (and be prepared to describe) a workflow for doing this
in general (i.e. suppose you were given this every day for a week, how
would you proceed?)  Feel free to draw...

Issues to consider: how does adding more people to local groups help
or hurt?  How does adding more people to remote groups help or hurt?
What kind of data preparation steps would be a good investment, if you
were given the data in a Python script and could manipulate it at
will?  (Think: sorting? trimming off the end? removing?)

Final question -- each of the data sets (collections of paper) you got
have different properties.  Some of them are marked -- others aren't.
What are the different properties that aren't marked?

In-class questions to answer (in groups):

   1. What did the simulation add to the Cell paper that you all read?
   (Drummond and Wilke)

   2. What evidence was provided that the mechanism of selection
   against misfolding is cytotoxicity? Can you think of alternative
   mechanisms?
