    http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/content/16/1/16.long

The assigned group should read & present these two papers in addition to the
first:

    http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0004688
    
Group members should consider addressing these questions:

 1. What, if anything, can be inferred about the difference in *mechanism*
 behind sequence change in E. coli and S. purpuratus from the Brown/Callan
 paper and the Cameron paper?

 2. What, if anything, can be inferred about the difference in *mechanism*
 behind sequence change in flies and S. purpuratus from the Peterson
 paper and the Cameron paper?

Reading homework (due Wednesday, midnight Pacific time)
-------------------------------------------------------

Answer the questions in ~short paragraph form:

  1. In the Brown/Callan paper, a large number of unknown crp
  binding sites are predicted in the E. coli genome.  Do you
  believe these predictions?  If so, or if not, why?  Justify.

  2. What is the most compelling piece of (computational) evidence in
  the Brown/Callan paper that supports these predictions?  (Even if
  you don't believe any of it ;)
