Programming Homework (due Wednesday, midnight Pacific time)
-----------------------------------------------------------

1. Install an SSH program and configure it to log into your EC2
machine; see :doc:`starting-your-cloud-system`.

2. Once logged in, enable Dropbox on your EC2 machine (see:
:doc:`../tutorials-2011/installing-dropbox`)

3. Put the matplotlib running-average code from :doc:`tutorial-6` (the
first example plot) into a file called
'plot-running-average.py'.  Put it in dropbox on your local computer,
and then run it on your EC2 machine by typing ::

   %% python ~/Dropbox/plot-running-average.py

Commit it to your git repo and push it to your git repository.
Note: You'll need to modify the code to set ::

   image_file = '/root/Dropbox/graph.png'

before calling 'pyplot.savefig(image_file)'.  Once you run the code,
you should see the image in your Dropbox on your own computer, not
just your EC2 machine.

4) Build & run avida according to :doc:`building-and-running-avida`.
Send Titus the last line of your data/average.dat file, as per the end of
that tutorial.

5) Take the unit tests from the :doc:`class-links` for November 1st,
add them to the bottom of your Python homework, and update your file
in git so that they pass.  (If you could rename your file to something
like 'penny-utils.py' that would also be nice.)

**Be sure to shut down your Amazon instance when you're done.**
