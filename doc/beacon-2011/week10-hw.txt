  Lenski, Ofria, Pennock, Adami
  http://www.cse.msu.edu/~ofria/pubs/2003LenskiEtAl.pdf

and consider, for discussion in class, the following questions:

  Is this a simulation of evolution, or an instance?

  How or why does it matter for studying evolution?

  What evolutionary questions that interest you, might we be able to study
  with Avida?

Programming Homework (due Wednesday, midnight Pacific time)
-----------------------------------------------------------

1. Install an SSH program and configure it to log into your EC2
machine; see :doc:`starting-your-cloud-system`.

2. Once logged in, enable Dropbox on your EC2 machine (see:
:doc:`../tutorials-2011/installing-dropbox`)

3. Put the matplotlib running-average code from :doc:`tutorial-6`
(remove the dhtml stuff) into a file called 'plot-running-average.py'.
Put it in dropbox on your local computer, and then run it on your EC2
machine by typing ::

   %% python ~/Dropbox/plot-running-average.py

Commit it to your git repo and push it to your git repository.

4) Build & run avida according to :doc:`building-and-running-avida`.
Send Titus the last line of your data/average.dat file, as per the end of
that tutorial.

5) Take the unit tests from the :doc:`class-links` for November 1st,
add them to the bottom of your Python homework, and update your file
in git so that they pass.  (If you could rename your file to something
like 'penny-utils.py' that would also be nice.)

**Be sure to shut down your Amazon instance when you're done.**
