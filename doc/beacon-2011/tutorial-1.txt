Python is a programming language that we'll be using throughout the term.
Before we can really get started, we need to make sure that Crunchy is
installed and working.  Let's do that by welcoming you to Python in the
traditional way: writing a 'Hello, world' program.  However you loaded
this tutorial into Crunchy, you should see a line with a Python prompt ('>>>')
and ``print 'Hello, world'`` after it.  Below that is a big '?' sign and
a text entry box.   Type the 'print' text (full line) into the text box
and hit return.

   >>> print 'Hello, world'

You should see 'Hello, world' emerge!  This is your first Python command:
you've just told the Python language interpreter to output 'Hello, world'
to the screen.  Congrats, you're now a programmer, and you can add
'Python programming' to your resume!

We'll spend a fair amount of time over the next few weeks on Python syntax,
but for now let's introduce two concepts: running functions, and doing math.

Running functions
-----------------

You pretty much always want to do something to something else when
you're programming.  For starters, suppose you want to get the length
of some text.  How can we do this?

In Python, text is always stored as a *string of characters*, or
*string* for short.  In the above example, 'Hello, world' is a string
-- it's enclosed in quotes.  You can use single quotes or double
quotes ("Hello, world") -- Python doesn't care which as long as you
remember to close the string with the same type of quote as you opened
it with.  Internal quotes are ignored -- so, for example, "Hello,
'friend'" represents the string ``Hello, 'friend'``, which can be
quite handy for printouts.

Once you have your string figured out, to get the length you want to
apply the function len() to it.  You do this by writing
``len(<string>)``, replacing <string> with an actual string -- try it!

  >>> print len('Hello, world')

You should see '12', which is how many characters are in the string 'Hello,
world'.  What you're doing here is running the function "len" on the
string 'Hello, world'.

**Homework problem 1:** Ask Python to calculate the number of characters
in the string::

   The quick brown fox jumped over the 'lazy' dog.

Copy the Python command you write for this into the homework form for
HW 1, Problem 1.  Here's a prompt to work at:

  >>>

*Hint: the length is longer than 40 and less than 50...*

Doing math
----------

The Python interpreter is also a great way to do some quick math.
You can do addition with +, subtraction with -, multiplication with ``*``,
division with /, and grouping with '(' and ')'.  Try running these
commands:

   >>> print 9 + 1
   >>> print 11 - 1
   >>> print 5 * 2
   >>> print 20 / 2
   >>> print 19. / 2.
   >>> print 5 + 10/2
   >>> print (10 + 10) / 2

(Note: if you click on the little notepad on the right, it will copy all
of these commands into the Python interpreter for you.)

**Homework problem 2:** Ask Python to calculate the sum of 199438510 and
664642161, divided by 4.  Copy the Python command you write for this into
the homework form HW1, Problem 2.  Here's a prompt!

And... you're done with the programming part of HW 1!
