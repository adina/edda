Reading homework (due Monday, midnight Pacific time)
----------------------------------------------------

Of what value was the dN/dS simulation in the Drummond & Wilke paper?
Please be prepared to discuss your answer in class.

Also, please make the following two lists and bring them to class:

 - What data or information would you need to have if you wanted to
   repeat the simulation from scratch yourself?

 - What data or information would you need to have if you wanted to
   replicate the results of the paper from scratch yourself?

Programming Homework (due Wednesday, midnight Pacific time)
-----------------------------------------------------------

1. Create an account at http://github.com/.

2. Create an account at http://dropbox.com/, if you don't already have one.

3. Create an account at http://aws.amazon.com/.

4. Enable your AWS account for EC2 (log in, and click the EC2 tab;
    then follow the instructions).  **This will involve both inputting
    credit card information and receiving a phone call.**

5. By Wed midnight, send me the e-mail address associated with your
   AWS account.

6.  Add two functions to the homework from :doc:`week6-hw`::

       get_fishes_by_datelist(fish_d, datelist)

    and::

       get_dates_by_fishlist(dates_d, fishlist)

    where both 'datelist' and 'fishlist' are *lists of dates and fishes*
    rather than individual dates or fishes as in HW 6.

    The first function should return a list of those fish that were
    eaten on the dates given in 'datelist', which is a list of dates.

    The second function should return a list of those dates on which
    the fish given in 'fishlist' (a list of fish) were eaten.

7. Upload your file to github by doing the following:

  - first, create a new repository.  Go to github.com, select 'New repository.'
    Put something simple and lowercase in for "Project Name", like
    "cse891-fall-2011".

  - on a Mac,

    + download & install "GitHub for Mac" app from http://mac.github.com/.
    + run the app.
    + log into your github account (on startup, OR in Preferences... pane)
    + in the "Repository" window (default window, or View... Repositories)
      click on your account under GitHub (on the left).
    + for the repository you created (cse891-fall-2011, for example) click
      "Clone to Computer".  Put it anywhere you want -- your Desktop is
      fine, as is the default.

      This will copy your remote github files to your local computer.

    + Outside of the github app, copy the file containing your homework
      6 & 7 into the repository directory that you selected.  For example,
      on my computer, I put the file under Desktop... cse891-fall-2011.

    + Go back to the GitHub app and click on the right-pointing arrow in the
      lozenge corresponding to your repository.

    + Now click on "Changes".  Enter "adding homework" for "Commit summary",
      and click on "Commit changes."  You should now see "1 unsynchronized
      commit" just above the "adding homework" message.

    + On the upper right of the window, click "Publish branch."

    + You should now be able to go to http://github.com/, select your
      cse891 repository under "Your repositories" on the far right,
      and see your homework file.  If so, success! If not, something
      went wrong :(.

  - on a Windows machine,

    + download GitExtensions from http://gitextensions.googlecode.com/files/GitExtensions225SetupComplete.msi
    + install it.  Select "Install MsysGit" and "Install KDiff" when asked.
      Also select "plink" (the default) for the ssh connection.  Keep all
      defaults for everything else (just keep clickin' "OK"...)

    + After installation is finished, run "Git... Git GUI" from the Start
      menu.

    + In the "Clone Existing Repository" window, put the Web address
      of your repository into "Source Location".  This can be found by
      going to your github repository Web site (something like
      'https://github.com/ctb/cse891-fall-2011-test', but for your
      project) and selecting the 'HTTP' tab; it should look like this
      URL below, but with your username replacing 'ctb' and your
      repository name replacing 'cse891-fall-2011-test'.

            https://ctb@github.com/ctb/cse891-fall-2011-test.git

      Make sure that you copy the URL *exactly* without any leading spaces.

      For "Target Directory", just select some common location (like, say,
      your Desktop) and add the name of your repository after it, e.g.

            .../Desktop/cse891-fall-2011-test

      Then select 'Clone'

    + You may need to type in your github password several times...

    + Now, go to IDLE or whatever you're using to edit Python files,
      and save your hw file into the git directory that you created
      (for me, 'cse891-fall-2011-test').
    + Return to the Git GUI application, and click "Rescan".  (Middle.)
    + Your hw file should show up under "Unstaged changes".  Select it,
      and go to the menu "Commit" and select "Stage to commit".
    + Type "homework 6 and 7!" in the "Commit Message" window, and then
      click "Commit."
    + Now select "push".  You'll have to type your password in again.
    + It should say "successful!" -- just close that window.
    + You should now be able to go to http://github.com/, select your
      cse891 repository under "Your repositories" on the far right,
      and see your homework file.  If so, success! If not, something
      went wrong :(.

(If you are already a git/github expert, go ahead and do it however you want :)
