Programming Homework (due Wednesday, midnight Pacific time)
-----------------------------------------------------------

1. Run & save at least two different Avida experiments to 50,000
generations, one with the default task environment and one with at
least one non-EQU task eliminated. NOTE: each experiment may take up
to 24 hours to run!  See the instructions here:
:doc:`running-and-saving-avida-results`.

2. Plot the evolutionary fitness of each run together on an x-y plot,
adapting `this script <>`__ to do so.  You may want to set the X axis to
log scale @@.  Here is an example file to try.  Remember to establish
Dropbox as per :doc:`../tutorials-2011/installing-dropbox`.
