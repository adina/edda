  Lenski, Ofria, Pennock, Adami
  http://www.cse.msu.edu/~ofria/pubs/2003LenskiEtAl.pdf

and consider, for discussion in class, the following questions:

  How does mutation rate affect evolution?

  How does population size in Avida affect evolution?

  How is world topology likely to affect evolution?

Programming Homework (due Wednesday, midnight Pacific time)
-----------------------------------------------------------

1. Run & save at least two different Avida experiments to 50,000
updates, one with the default task environment and one with at
least one non-EQU task eliminated. NOTE: each experiment may take up
to 24 hours to run!  See the instructions here:
:doc:`running-and-saving-avida-results`.

2. Plot the evolutionary fitness of each run together on an x-y plot,
adapting `this script
<https://raw.github.com/ctb/edda/master/doc/beacon-2011/week11/plot-fitness.py>`__
to do so.  You may want to set the X axis to log scale by switching
'plot' to 'semilogx'.  The simplest way to go about running this is to
establish Dropbox on your EC2 machine, as per
:doc:`../tutorials-2011/installing-dropbox`; then, copy the
'plot-fitness.py' file into your local computer's Dropbox directory.
Now you can run it on your remote EC2 machine by doing ::

   %% python /root/Dropbox/plot-fitness.py


3. Save copies of each 50k run average.dat file by putting them in your
Dropbox folder, like so::

   %% cp /data/experiment1/data/average.dat /root/Dropbox/experiment1-average.dat

(but for each experiment directory) and then e-mail them to me at
titus@idyll.org (all attached to one e-mail is fine).  Please note down
what you did to generate each experiment file (eliminated tasks, etc.)
