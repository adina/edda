mRNAseq Assembly with Velvet & Oases

Velvet is designed for DNA assembly. To assemble short reads from RNA, we
need another program called Oases. In this tutorial, we will try assembling
the same data with Velvet and with Velvet + Oases to see how Oases improves
RNA assembly. We will also explore the effect of different
hashlengths (k-mer) on
isoform detection. 

Getting Started
---------------

First, please make sure that you already have Velvet installed on your
machine.
See: :doc:`short-read-assembly-velvet`.

To obtain current version of Oases, use wget::

    %% wget http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~zerbino/oases/oases_0.1.21.tgz

Then uncompress the file using tar::

    %% tar xvfz oases_0.1.21.tgz
    %% cd oases_0.1.21/

You should now be in oases directory. To install Oases you have to specify
Velvet directory and compilation settings used to install Velvet.
For example, in the previous tutorial we use MAXKMERLENGTH=49. Therefore,
we have to use MAXKMERLENGTH=49 to install Oases as well. In addition, we
also have to specify Velvet directory with 'VELVET_DIR'=/path/to/velvet.
From the above settings, you can install Oases with make::

    %% make 'VELVET_DIR=/root/velvet_1.1.04' 'MAXKMERLENGTH=49'

Note, use a full path for VELVET_DIR. A relative path might not work.
In addition, system variable such as $HOME, might not work here either.
Then copy oases to /usr/bin::

    %% cp oases /usr/bin

Now we should be ready to assemble short reads with both Velvet and Oases.
Let's move to the /mnt for a larger space.

    %% cd /mnt

To assemble reads with Velvet, run::

    %% velveth transcripts_k31 -short -fastq /data/rnaseq/chicken/reads.fastq
    %% velvetg transcripts_k31 -read_trkg yes

Note that we have to turn on '-read_trkg yes' option to allow Oases to use assembled
contigs from Velvet.
Then run Oases::

    %% oases transcripts_k31

The transcripts.fa will be written in the output directory of Velvet, k31
in this case.
We can go look at the output::

    %% cd transcripts_k31
    %% less transcripts.fa

For RNAseq, it is not uncommon that different hashlengths give you
different results. Some isoforms are only detected using a particular
hashlength.
So, you might need to run Velvet and Oases with different hashlength to
increase the sensitivity of isoform detection.
To run Velvet with multiple hashlengths, for example hashlength=21-31, run::

    %% velveth transcripts 21,33,2 -short -fastq /data/rnaseq/chicken/reads.fastq

Then you can run velvetg and oases for each hashlength using::

    %% velvetg transcripts_21 -read_trkg yes
    %% oases transcripts_21

Or you can use a shell script to run velvetg for hashlength=21-31::

    %% for((n=21; n<=31; n=n+2)); do velvetg transcripts_"$n" -read_trkg yes; done

And you can run Oases the same way::

    %% for((n=21; n<=31; n=n+2)); do oases transcripts_"$n"; done

After the assembly is finished, you can go to each directory to look at the
result. You should see that there are more than two isoforms in some hashlengths.
