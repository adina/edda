Cufflinks uses mapping result from Tophat to build gene models.
Please go to http://cufflinks.cbcb.umd.edu/ for more information.

Install Cufflinks
-----------------

First go to your home directory::

    %% cd ~/

Copy the binary file from cufflinks website and uncompress the tarball file::

    %% wget http://cufflinks.cbcb.umd.edu/downloads/cufflinks-1.0.3.Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
    %% tar xvfz cufflinks-1.0.3.Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
    %% cd cufflinks-1.0.3.Linux_x86_64

Add cufflinks directory to PATH enviroment variable::

    %% export PATH=$PATH:$PWD

Run cufflinks
-------------

If you already have the output from Tophat, you can run Cufflinks with it
right away. If you don't have Tophat output yet, please see
:doc:mrnaseq-tophat-mapping for how to run Tophat.

Suppose we have Tophat output in /mnt/chr25.tophat, run cufflinks with this
command::
    
    %% cd /mnt
    %% cufflinks -o chr25.cufflinks chr25.tophat/accepted_hits.bam

To explore the output, go to the output directory::

    %% cd chr25.cufflinks
    %% ls

You should see all the files as listed below::

    %% genes.fpkm_tracking  isoforms.fpkm_tracking  transcripts.gtf

Gene models are saved in GTF format and can be visualized in UCSC genome.
Please save the output for the visualization tutorial in the afternoon.
