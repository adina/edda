For this (short) tutorial, we will be creating some basic plots in 
matplotlib. The primary purpose is to show that Python can produce 
many of the plots that R can, so some of the plots we will be 
producing are redundant from the R tutorial(s). 

Getting Started
---------------
Start or log in to an instance on Amazon EC2 and get Dropbox 
(see :doc:`installing-dropbox') set up. 
We will be using the files in the Dropbox/ngs-scripts/matplotlib 
directory. Python and matplotlib are already installed, so we 
don't need to install any new packages.

Simple Histograms
-----------------
The first graph that we will produce is a simple histogram with 
generated data. It is located at ~/Dropbox/ngs-scripts/matplotlib/hist.py. 
A png file of the histogram will be placed in your Dropbox folder 
by running::

   %% python ~/Dropbox/ngs-scripts/matplotlib/hist.py

mRNAseq Read Count Comparison
-----------------------------
Now, we will create a read count comparison between two different 
samples in a lamprey dataset. You can generate this plot by 
executing::

   %% python ~/Dropbox/ngs-scripts/matplotlib/readcounts.py ~/Dropbox/ngs-scripts/matplotlib/mrna.csv

MA-plot
-------
Finally, we will create an MA-plot for the same two samples by running::

   %% python ~/Dropbox/ngs-scripts/matplotlib/maplot.py ~/Dropbox/ngs-scripts/matplotlib/mrna.csv
