Interval operations with BEDtools

In this tutorial we will familiarize ourselves with `BEDTools`_ a suite of command line tools with which to compare
large sets of genomic features. You should start this tutorial at a prompt that looks something like this::

   root@ip-10-82-233-6:~#

Our computer will need additional developer tools that allow us to install this and other software 
directly from sourcecode. We need the `g++` (c++ compiler) and `make` 
(compiler utility). Modern Linux package managers (`apt-get`, `yum` etc) allow for an easy installation::

  %% apt-get install g++
  %% apt-get install make

Now, make a directory for the chipseq data::

  %% mkdir chipseq
  %% cd chipseq/

Download, extract and compile the bedtools source code::

  %% wget http://bedtools.googlecode.com/files/BEDTools.v2.12.0.tar.gz
  %% tar zxvf BEDTools.v2.12.0.tar.gz
  %% cd BEDTools-Version-2.12.0
  %% make 

You should now have all the bedtool utilites in your `bin` directory::

  %% ls bin

The output of the command above should be similar to::

  annotateBed  bedToIgv       cuffToTrans   genomeCoverageBed  mergeBed    shuffleBed   unionBedGraphs
  bamToBed     closestBed     fastaFromBed  intersectBed       overlap     slopBed      windowBed
  bed12ToBed6  complementBed  fjoin         linksBed           pairToBed   sortBed
  bedToBam     coverageBed    flankBed      maskFastaFromBed   pairToPair  subtractBed

For reference download the `BEDTools User manual`_ onto your local computer. BEDTools quite possibly has the
best documentation of any bioinformatics tool in existence. 

.. note:: If you are reading this document a few months after June 2011 then 
   the links above may be outdated. Check the `BEDTools`_ site for the most up to date sourcecode and documentation.

Now let us continue on, test that the tools run::

  %% bin/closestBed

It should print a detailed help. In this tutorial we will only type the command name.  
In the most general case to access one of these programs you will need to either type the full path to the the command, like so::

  %% ~/chipseq/BEDTools-Version-2.12.0/bin/closestBed

Or add the `bin` directory above to the search path::

  %% export PATH=$PATH:/~/chipseq/BEDTools-Version-2.12.0/bin

Let's go back to the main chipseq directory:

  %% cd ~/chipseq/

We will now download two datasets, mapped reads (in GFF format)6/9/2011
