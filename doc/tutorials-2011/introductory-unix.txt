Unix commands can seem a bit cryptic. This tutorial will explore some of the more common ones. For any command, there is typically a man page, which is accessed using man *command*.::

  %% man ls
  %% man cp
  %% man rm

Getting Started
---------------

Start or log in to an instance on Amazon EC2.

Directories and Navigation
--------------------------

In Unix-based operating systems, directory paths come in two flavors: Absolute 
paths, which are prefixed with a "/", and relative paths, which are not.

There are also special codes to denote specific directories, like your home 
directory, which is represented by a "~" in a path. The ~ acts as an absolute 
path. Others are "." which denotes your current directory, and ".." is the 
parent directory. These commands demonstrate different ways of going in and 
out of a directory you have created in your home directory.::

  %% mkdir a_directory
  %% cd ~/a_directory
  %% cd ..
  %% cd a_directory
  %% cd ~
  %% cd ./a_directory

To see where you are in the filesystem, use pwd.::

  %% pwd

To remove a directory you've created, use rmdir.::

  %% rmdir a_directory

To create an empty file, use touch::

  %% touch file.txt

To view the files in a directory, use ls::

  %% ls 
  %% ls /
  %% ls ./
  %% ls ../

ls can also use wildcards, for example to show only the text files in a directory.::

  %% ls *.txt

To copy a file, use cp::

  %% cp file.txt file_copy.txt

To move or rename a file, use mv::

  %% mv file_copy.txt file_thing.txt

You can also use paths in any of these commands::

  %% cp file.txt /mnt/file.txt
  %% mv /mnt/file.txt ~/acopy.txt

To remove a file, use rm::

  %% rm acopy.txt
  %% ls

To output the content of a file, use cat.::

  %% cat /etc/passwd

To output only the first few lines of a file, use head::

  %% head -5 /etc/passwd

Similarly, to output only the last few lines of a file, use tail::

  %% tail -5 /etc/passwd

The -5 is the number of lines to output.

To view a file that you can navigate using the up and down arrows, use less::

  %% less /etc/passwd

Editing Files
-------------

A common and easy to use text editor is nano::

  %% touch file2.txt
  %% nano file2.txt

The commands within pico should be pretty self-explanatory.


Copying Files Over the Network
------------------------------

To copy files from one computer to another, both of which have ssh access, 
use scp. To copy a local file from your computer to a remote computer::

  %% scp file.txt username@othercomputer.com:~/

To copy a set of remote files that end with .txt to your local computer::
 
  %% scp username@othercomputer.com:~/*.txt ./

All of the paths also work with wildcards, in general. I encourage you to 
experiment.

If the files you want to fetch are on a web server, you can use either wget 
or curl to fetch the file.::

  %% curl -O http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~zerbino/velvet/velvet_1.1.04.tgz
  %% wget http://www.ebi.ac.uk/~zerbino/velvet/velvet_1.1.04.tgz


Connecting to Remote Computers
------------------------------

To connect to a remote computer that you have ssh access to, use ssh.::

  %% ssh username@remotecomputer.com

Then, enter your password.

To log in using a private key, use the -i flag.::

  %% ssh -i <pathtoprivatekey> <username@remotecomputer.com>


Pipes & Grep
------------

To connect the output of one program into the input of another, use pipes.

For example, we can list the content of a directory, and search it for a
particular pattern using grep.::

  %% ls | grep txt

Grep searches what is input to it for the text that is defined.

Compression and Decompression
-----------------------------

Often, files you download will be compressed with .tar.gz

To compress your own files, use tar in compression mode::

  %% tar -zvcf compressed.tar.gz file.txt

To decompress them, use tar in decompression mode::

  %% tar -zxvf compressed.tar.gz
