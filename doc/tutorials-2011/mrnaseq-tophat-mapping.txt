RNAseq mapping with Tophat
==========================

Tophat is developed to map reads from RNAseq to a reference sequence and to detect splice junctions.
Please go to http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu/index.html for more information
about Tophat.
Tophat uses Bowtie to map reads to the reference sequence, therefore we
have to install Bowtie first.

Install Bowtie
--------------

First, go to your home directory::

    %% cd ~/

Download the binary file and untar it::

    %% wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/bowtie-bio/files/bowtie/0.12.7/bowtie-0.12.7-linux-x86_64.zip
    %% unzip bowtie-0.12.7-linux-x86_64.zip
    %% cd bowtie-0.12.7

Then, copy executable files to /usr/bin::

    %% cp bowtie /usr/bin
    %% cp bowtie-build /usr/bin
    %% cp bowtie-inspect /usr/bin

Install Tophat
--------------

Download the binary file and untar it::

    %% cd ~/
    %% wget http://tophat.cbcb.umd.edu/downloads/tophat-1.3.0.Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
    %% tar xvfz tophat-1.3.0.Linux_x86_64.tar.gz
    %% cd tophat-1.3.0.Linux_x86_64

Then include Tophat in PATH environment variable::

    %% export PATH=$PATH:$PWD

Install Samtools
----------------

Download the source file and untar it::

    %% cd ~/
    %% wget http://sourceforge.net/projects/samtools/files/samtools/0.1.16/samtools-0.1.16.tar.bz2
    %% tar xvfj samtools-0.1.16.tar.bz2

Note "tar xvfj" command is used to uncompress file in bz2 format. Use "tar
xvfz" instead to uncompress file in gzip format. 

Complie samtools::

    %% cd samtools-0.1.16
    %% make

Lastly, add samtools in PATH environment variable::

    %% export PATH=$PATH:$PWD

Get data
--------
In this tutorial, we will map sigle-end reads from chicken to the reference
genome. For demonstration purpose, I have selected reads that mapped to
chromosome 25.
You can copy reads and a reference files from Dropbox::

    %% cd /mnt
    %% cp ~/Dropbox/ngs-scripts/tophat/chr25.fa .
    %% cp ~/Dropbox/ngs-scripts/tophat/chr25.fastq .

Build Bowtie index
------------------
Before running Tophat we need to build the index for the reference
sequence::

    %% bowtie-build chr25.fa chr25

Run Tophat
----------
To run tophat execute this command::

    %% tophat -o chr25.tophat chr25 chr25.fastq

Output files will be in the output directory. We specify the output
directory using "-o <directory>" option. 
To explore the output go to chr25.tophat directory::

    %% cd chr25.tophat
    %% ls

You will see all files as listed below::

    %% accepted_hits.bam  deletions.bed  insertions.bed  junctions.bed  left_kept_reads.info  logs

The mapping result is saved in BAM format in accepted_hits.bam.
Splice junctions are saved in BED format in junctions.bed.
Deletions and insertions are also in BED format in deletions.bed and
insertions.bed. You can take a look at junctions.bed using "less" command.
However, you cannot look at accepted_hits.bam because it is in binary
format.
Please save all the output. We will visualize them using UCSC genome
browser in the afternoon.
