===================================
Using the pre-installed Avida image
===================================

We've built an Avida machine image (AMI), so you don't have to go through
the whole system update, upgrade, and build process any more.

To use this image, search for 'avida.beacon.msu.edu' under
'Community AMIs' when launching a new image.  Its current AMI
ID is 'ami-2ecb3f47' but that will change if we update it.

Updating the version of avida
-----------------------------

One thing that you might want to do is *update the installed version of
Avida*.  For example, if you found a bug and got it fixed, or needed to
use a newly added feature, you'd need to update your instance of the AMI
to have the newer version.

**You'll need to do this for every new instance!  The AMI is a frozen
snapshot at a point in time, and it isn't that simple to update.**

It's fairly simple set of commands to update avida.  Immediately after
login, do::

  %% cd ~/avida
  %% svn update
  %% make
  %% cp bin/avida /usr/local/bin

and that's it!  Briefly, what you're doing here is:

 - updating the Avida source code from its source repository.  This command
   is very similar to the 'git pull' command that you need to use to update
   the 'beacon' source repository.

 - re-building Avida from the new source files

 - copying the new version of Avida over the old version (in /usr/local/bin).

tada!
