A SNP scavenger hunt: finding SNPs in evolved Campylobacter jejuni
==================================================================

**Brief overview:** JP Jerome in the Mansfield lab performed an
experimental evolution experiment with the bacterium Campylobacter
jejuni, an enteric pathogen: he took a freezer strain (11168; see `the
genbank record <http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/30407139>`__) and
passaged it through mice three times.  During these passages it
dramatically increased in virulence.  JP then sequenced the
pre-passage population and the post-passage population using Illumina
short-read sequencing.  We would like to provide JP with a set of loci
that have changed during passage and could underlie the increase in
virulence.

Note that Campylobacter is haploid.  It also has an extremely high
mutation rate in which "contingency loci", poly-G tracts, expand and
contract.  Because of this there is no such thing as a clonal
population of C. jejuni, but rather only a population "cloud".

Your goal is to identify genomic locations that have changed during
this passage, i.e. find locations where there is a real difference
between pre-passage and post-passage genomes.  Note that no structural
variation (large-scale rearrangements, copy number variation, etc.)
was detected by gel electrophoresis, so you're only looking for single
nucleotide changes (SNPs) and insertion-deletion characters (indels).

Be sure to consider how you might detect systematic bias, and whether
or not a particular SNP is evolutionarily plausible.  You should think
about how you might systematize the process, too.

Working with the data
---------------------

We've provided a bunch of mappings with a wide range of parameters
under '/mnt' on the two computers
'ec2-75-101-241-129.compute-1.amazonaws.com' and
'ec2-184-72-194-33.compute-1.amazonaws.com', username 'root', password
'891'.  Each directory, 'mapping-*', contains a set of 'pre' and
'post' mapping files; you can use e.g. 'tview' (as in the
:doc:`../tutorials/samtools-tutorial`) to view them::

   cd /mnt/mapping-n1
   samtools tview pre.map.sorted.bam ../data/campy.fa

or::

   samtools tview post.map.sorted.bam ../data/campy.fa

At the bottom of this page, I've provided a list of locations for you
to examine.  There may be other "interesting" locations that you should
feel free to explore, but these encompass the types of variation in the
genome.

Looking at the data
-------------------

The primary way to look at the data is through the use of 'samtools tview'.
For example, to look at the results of a default parameter mapping of the
pre-passage reads to the Campy genome, use::

   cd /mnt/default
   samtools tview pre.map.sorted.bam ../data/campy.fa

To look at the mapping of the post-passage reads, look at post.map.sorted.bam::

   samtools tview post.map.sorted.bam ../data/campy.fa

You can get a list of different mappings by doing::

   ls -1d /mnt/mapping-*

and the individual mapping parameters are in the file 'parameters'.

Navigating inside of 'tview'
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

'.' and ',' represent forward-mapped reads and reverse-mapped reads,
respectively.

You can use your up and down arrows to scroll along the aligned reads.

Left and right will change the primary nucleotide.

A 'g', followed by '=' and a number, will reset the location of the viewer
to that location.  So typing 'g=2736' will go to position 2736 (see below
for a list of positions).

'q' will quit the tview.

'?' will give you a list of other options.

See :doc:`../tutorials/samtools-tutorial` for other options.

A list of locations
-------------------

Our C. jejuni strain is approximately 1.5 mb in size, with a single
chromosome named 'campy_genome'.

Please try to classify some or all of the following locations as
**real SNP difference pre/post**, **real indel**, **sequencing
error/bias**, **no variation**.
