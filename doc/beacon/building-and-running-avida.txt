Building and installing Avida
=============================

We'll talk about Avida -- what it is and what it does -- at some
length in this course, but the first thing we want to do is get it up
and running.  For now, for more information on Avida you can visit the
`Avida development site @ the Devolab <http://avida.devosoft.org/>`__.

First, log into the system as detailed in :doc:`../tutorials/unix-and-ssh-and-scp`.  You
should arrive at a '%' prompt.

At this prompt, type::

  %% apt-get update

This updates the map of available software.  Now install some::

  %% apt-get -y install g++ subversion cmake

We'll talk about what these packages are down the road, but for now --
just copy and paste.

OK, this is the minimum necessary to run avida -- so let's go get the
avida source code! ::

  %% svn co https://avida.devosoft.org/svn/development avida

It will ask you a question about a dodgy security certificate -- type
'p' to accept permanently.

This puts the Avida source code into the directory 'avida'.  Now, change
into that directory, configure the build system, and build avida::

  %% cd avida
  %% cmake .
  %% make

Assuming success, now we want to install avida in a central location::

  %% cp bin/avida /usr/local/bin

Next, make a new directory, change into it, and configure it to be an
avida working directory by copying ('cp') in a bunch of files::

  %% mkdir beacon
  %% cd beacon
  %% cp ../support/config/{avida,environment,instset-heads}.cfg .
  %% cp ../support/config/default-heads.org .

Finally, retrieve a course-specific config file::

  %% curl -O http://ged.msu.edu/angus/files/events.cfg

This will take a pre-written 'events' configuration file for avida from
this course Web site and save it into the local directory.

At this point, double check yourself: if things worked, you should be
able to run 'print working directory', ::

  %% pwd

and see '/root/avida/beacon'.  You can also look at the files present with
'list files': ::

  %% ls

You should see::

   avida.cfg  default-heads.org  environment.cfg  events.cfg  instset-heads.cfg

You should now be able to run 'avida' and get a bunch of output. ::

  %% avida

Congrats!  You've successfully installed & configured avida and run it
once!
