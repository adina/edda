Measuring avida memory usage
============================

Follow these easy steps to measure Avida's memory usage.

1. Log into your EC2 machine.

2. Compile and configure Avida.

3. Run Avida

4. Start up a new window and log into the same machine

5. Run 'top' and read off the memory usage of Avida (see :doc:`../tutorials/using-top`)

What we're going to experiment with in class are the WORLD_X and WORLD_Y
settings, to see how they relate to memory usage.
