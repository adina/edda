=====================================================
Revised instructions for running Avida (with scripts)
=====================================================

Start up your machine as normal.

Instead of running any of the install commands, do this instead::

  %% apt-get update
  %% apt-get -y install git-core

Now download all of the BEACON scripts from my github account (more on that
later)::

  %% git clone git://github.com/ctb/beacon.git

This will create a directory 'beacon', with a directory 'avida' under it.
The 'avida' directory will contain the following (text) files)::

   install-software.sh
   build-avida.sh
   run-avida.sh
   parse-average.py
   get-dominant.py

We'll go through one by one, but most of the commands in the '.sh'
files should be pretty recognizable...  Anything ending with 'sh' is a
bash shell script, and anything ending with '.py' is a Python script
(by convention, not by requirement!)

First, run 'install-software.sh'.::

   %% bash beacon/avida/install-software.sh

Then, run 'build-avida'::

   %% bash beacon/avida/build-avida.sh

Edit the config file(s) in 'avida/beacon' appropriately using 'nano'::

   %% nano avida/beacon/events.cfg

and/or ::

   %% nano avida/beacon/avida.cfg

Now, go run 'run-avida'::

   %% bash beacon/avida/run-avida.sh

Now you'll have a bunch of data directories named 'data.1' through 'data.10'
in the 'avida/beacon' subdirectory.  You can run 'parse-average.py' and
'get-dominant.py' on each one::

   %% python beacon/avida/parse-average.py avida/beacon/data.1

   %% python beacon/avida/get-dominant.py avida/beacon/data.1
