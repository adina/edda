====================
Running Avida longer
====================

You may want to have these tutorials ready to hand:

 * :doc:`../tutorials/unix-directories-and-files`
 * :doc:`../tutorials/setting-up-an-ebs-volume`
 * :doc:`../tutorials/using-the-nano-editor`
 * Running jobs while you sleep: the 'screen' section of :doc:`../unix-cheat-sheet`
 * :doc:`../tutorials/using-top`


First, go through the installation and configuration stage of
:doc:`building-and-running-avida`, except you can do it on a permanently
stored disk if you like.

Now, let's edit 'events.cfg' to run for 5000 updates instead of 500: ::

  %% nano events.cfg

and change the line 'u 500 Exit' to 'u 5000 exit'.

Now, start 'screen'.

Run::

  %% avida

Detach 'screen' with 'CTRL-A d'.  Use top to verify that avida is
running. Log out.

Go get a cup of coffee.

Log back in and use 'top' to see if avida is still running.  (It is!)

Re-attach to the screen with 'screen -r'.

Hey, look at that!
