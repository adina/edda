Using ssh-agent to log in (Mac OS X)
------------------------------------

Are you getting tired of using 'ssh -i $some_long_key_path>
root@$some_long_machine_name' to connect to your Amazon machine?  You
can do the following::

   %% eval `ssh-agent`
   %% ssh-add $some_long_key_path

and then, until you exit that shell, you can just do ::

   %% ssh root@$some_long_machine_name

and it will no longer ask you for your key.
