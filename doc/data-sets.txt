Data Sets (for Fun and Profit)
------------------------------

We have a number of next-gen sequencing data sets available for use in
the course.  Some of them are public and/or published, while others
will only be accessible to you while you're at the course (you can ask
for special permission, afterwards, but it's up to the PI).
