Analyzing genome mutations

This tutorial is really just a sandbox where you can make your own
mutations to a genome, simulate reads data, and run it through
_breseq_ to see what it can find.

Go to the tutorial directory::

  %% cd /mnt/breseq_tutorial/02_mutate

Edit the file "mutations.gd". Each line must conform to the
specifications given in :doc:`breseq-test-drive`.  For example, you can
put::

   SNP     25      8       REL606F 1452    C       G

at the top of the file (make sure to separate the fields with TABs rather than
spaces).

Note that:

1. You can leave the "ref_seq" field of SNPs as just "." and put in
whatever bases you want in the "ref_seq" field of SUB mutations
(though the number does matter).

2. The only "element_name" you have access to for MOB mutations is
"IS1".

3. If you try to get too clever, and DEL a region containing a SNP,
for example, you will exceed what the MUTATE program is capable of
understanding and may get unexpected results.

4. The reference sequence is only 20,000 nt long, so be sure your
positions and sizes stay within this.

To generate your test data, execute these commands::

   %% genomediff MUTATE -r REL606.20kb_fragment.gbk mutations.gd
   %% fastq_utils SIMULATE -c 40 output.fna

The -c option is average coverage of reads to generate. You might try
raising or lowering it and seeing how it affects the results.  Be
aware that the simulated data is randomly Poisson distributed so it
will perform better at low coverage than real data.

Finally, test your data with _breseq_::

   %% breseq -r REL606.20kb_fragment.gbk -o breseq output.fastq
