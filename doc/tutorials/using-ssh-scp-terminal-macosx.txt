Using SSH/SCP on Mac OS X in the Terminal app
=============================================

For those of you using Mac laptops, Mac OS X comes with everything you need.

.. _using-ssh-macosx:

Using SSH on Mac OS X in Terminal
---------------------------------

First, find 'Terminal.app' (you can use Spotlight to search for
'Terminal app', or you can look in your Applications, Utilities
folder.)

Double-click on it.

You should now see a window with something like this: ::

   ...-macbook:~ Guest$ 

in it.  This is called 'the shell prompt', or the 'command-line
interface', and it's a low-level way to interact with the computer.
You can do all sorts of neat things here (including open applications,
edit and delete files, write programs, etc.) but mostly we're going to
use it to connect to the same kind of prompt, but on a remote
computer.

(Note that you can customize the font size, color, etc. of the
Terminal window to your liking.  I'm old and hard of eyesight, so I
like to make the font big: you can do that with command-shift-+.)

**From this point on, everything that follows the '%%' and is in
teletype font is something for you to type at a command line prompt.**

So, to start, type ::

  %% ssh -i $keyfile root@$amazon

replacing '$keyfile' with the location of your key file, and '$amazon'
with the hostname of your amazon machine.

The first time you do this on any computer, it will say something like
"the computer <some long name> is unknown to us; do you really want to
connect?" -- say "yes".

Now you should see a login banner followed by the prompt '... # '.

Now you can go back to the :doc:`unix-and-ssh-and-scp` tutorial, or
continue on to :ref:`transferring-files-with-scp`.

.. _transferring-files-with-scp:

Transferring files with SCP
---------------------------

Create a file on your local computer: in Terminal, at the shell prompt,
type: ::

 %% echo hello, world > a-file.txt

Now copy this file to the directory on the remote computer: ::

 %% scp -i $keyfile a-file.txt root@$amazon:

where you should again replace $keyfile and $amazon with your key filename
and your amazon machine name, respectively.

'scp' will ask for a password.  Give the same super-secret password we
gave you in class.

Note that you can also transfer files from remote machines to your local
machine::

  %% scp -i $keyfile root@$amazon:a-file.txt local-file.txt

More generally, the scp command will copy a local file to a remote location::

  %% scp <local file> <remote user>@<remote machine>:<remote path>

or vice versa, a remote file to a local file::

  %% scp <remote user>@<remote machine>:<remote path> <local file>
