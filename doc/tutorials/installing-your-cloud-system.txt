=================================
Installing your Amazon EC2 system
=================================

Start with a clean EC2 system (i.e. shut down whatever you've been
using, and start a new one).

Log in with your ssh identity key.

Now install X, Y, and Z.

(Apache, for serving files; pico...?)
