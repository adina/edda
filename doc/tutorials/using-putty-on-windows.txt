========================
Using SSH/SCP on Windows
========================

Unlike Mac OS X, Windows doesn't come with the necessary software.
There are lots of implementations of ssh and ssh-based programs for
logging in and doing file transfers; if you already know how to use
one, go ahead and use that.  Below are instructions for installing
PuTTY (remote login), WinSCP (file transfer), and Notepad++ (file
editing) on your Windows machine.

Installing software
===================

Install PuTTY
-------------

PuTTY is a free program that lets you log into remote computers using
ssh.

Download putty from here:

http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html

It's a standalone file that doesn't require any installation, so you
can just put it on your desktop.

Install WinSCP
---------------

Download WinSCP from here:

http://winscp.net/eng/download.php

You probably want the "Installation package".

(You don't need to install the Bing toolbar...)

Install the Notepad++ text editor
---------------------------------

Also install Notepad++, available here:

http://sourceforge.net/projects/notepad-plus/files/

You'll probably want to use the Installer (npp.5.6.8.Installer.exe).

Notepad++ is a text editor that lets you edit text files.

Logging in and transferring files
=================================

Using PuTTY
-----------

Double-click on the PuTTY application.

.. image:: images/windows-putty-connect.png

Enter 'lyorn.idyll.org' as the host, and leave everything else as a default.

Click 'connect'.  If it's your first time running this, you'll get a security
warning; click "yes".

.. image:: images/windows-putty-security-alert.png

And... now you're logged in!  Congrats!

.. image:: images/windows-putty-lyorn-login.png

One last thing. Type ::

 %% mkdir $directory

where you replace '$directory' with something unique (like your last name).
(Note: case matters; usually I make everything lowercase by default, so I don't
have to remember what case I used.)

This will give you a directory (folder) into which you can put things on
lyorn.  Since you're all using the same account on lyorn, if you don't
do this you will step on each other's files.

We won't be using lyorn too much, though, so this is just for this tutorial.

Now you can go back to the :doc:`unix-and-ssh-and-scp` tutorial, or
continue on to :ref:`editing-files-with-notepadpp` and
:ref:`transferring-files-with-winscp`.

.. _editing-files-with-notepadpp:

Use Notepad++ to create a file
------------------------------

Here, we're going to create a file so that we can transfer it over to
lyorn (just to demo file transfer).

Start Notepad++.

In the blank file that comes up by default, enter "hello, world" (or really
any random set of words).

Save as a file called 'a-file.txt' on your Desktop.

Close Notepad++.

.. _transferring-files-with-winscp:

Using WinSCP
------------

Start up WinSCP.

Enter 'lyorn.idyll.org' in as the host name, 'ngs' as the user name, and
the super-secret password as the password.  Leave everything else as 
default and click 'connect'.

.. image:: images/windows-winscp-login.png

You should now see a window with two panes.  The pane on the left
shows files and directories on your local hard drive.  The pane on the
right shows files and directories on the remote computer 'lyorn.idyll.org'.

.. image:: images/windows-winscp-transfer.png

Create a new directory named with your last name on the right pane, by
clicking the "new folder" icon.

.. image:: images/windows-winscp-createdir.png

Navigate to the desktop, and find 'a-file.txt' (the file you created
with Notepad++).  Select it and drag it to the right pane, into the directory
you just created.

.. image:: images/windows-winscp-desktop.png

Congratulations! You've just copied a file from your laptop to the remote
computer 'lyorn.idyll.org', all the way over at MSU!
