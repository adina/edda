breseq is a bacterial resequencing analysis pipeline initially
developed in Rich Lenski's lab at MSU for use in analyzing the Long
Term Evolution Experiment resequencing data.

First, go through :doc:`breseq-install`.

Now, here are some tutorials for your delectation!

Tutorial 1: :doc:`breseq-test-drive`

Tutorial 2: :doc:`breseq-mutate`

Tutorial 3: :doc:`breseq-find-transposon`

Tutorial 4: :doc:`breseq-mixed-population`
