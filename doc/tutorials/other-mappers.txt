The BWA aligner is available at http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/, or
(for the course) you can download it from here with curl:

   http://angus.ged.msu.edu.s3.amazonaws.com/bwa-0.5.7.tar.bz2

Installation
------------

Go to your home directory on your EC2 machine, /root::

   %% cd

Grab the source file::

   %% curl -O http://angus.ged.msu.edu.s3.amazonaws.com/bwa-0.5.7.tar.bz2

Unpack it, using 'j' instead of 'z' because it's a .bz2 file::

   %% tar xjf bwa-0.5.7.tar.bz2

Compile it::

   %% cd bwa-0.5.7
   %% make

Install the new 'bwa' program into /usr/local/bin::

   %% cp bwa /usr/local/bin

Now, go to your data directory.  I'll assume you're using the Campylobacter
1m read dataset from :doc:`bowtie-mapping`::

   %% cd /mnt/campy

Index the reference genome::

   %% bwa index -a is campy.fa

**Note**: for reference databases bigger than 10mb, you need to use '-a bwtsw';
for databases smaller than 10mb, you need to use '-a is', as per the 
`bwa man page <http://bio-bwa.sourceforge.net/bwa.shtml>`__.

And generate a mapping of all the reads::

   %% bwa aln campy.fa campy-pre-1m.fastq > campy-pre-1m.bwa.sai

This may take a few minutes.  You can speed it up on a two-core
machine by specifying '-t 2' (to use two threads).

This 'sai' file is a binary file that you can't look at with 'less'.  You
have to convert it to a SAM file::

   %% bwa samse campy.fa campy-pre-1m.bwa.sai campy-pre-1m.fastq > campy-pre-1m.bwa.sam

and finally, this SAM file can be viewed or interrogated using
samtools (see :doc:`samtools-tutorial`).  To do this, first make sure
that you've indexed 'campy.fa' with samtools::

  %% samtools faidx campy.fa

Now, convert the .sam file into a .bam file::

  %% samtools import campy.fa.fai campy-pre-1m.bwa.sam campy-pre-1m.bwa.bam

Sort it::

  %% samtools sort campy-pre-1m.bwa.bam campy-pre-1m.bwa.sorted

Index it::

  %% samtools index campy-pre-1m.bwa.sorted.bam 

...and now you can do all the other things that samtools lets you do,
such as retrieve mappings to specific intervals, ::

  %% samtools view campy-pre-1m.bwa.sorted.bam 'campy_genome:1-25'

or look at it with tview::

  %% samtools tview campy-pre-1m.bwa.sorted.bam
