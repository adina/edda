Using the Nano editor
=====================

One thing you'll almost certainly need to do is edit text files -- things
like scripts and configuration files.

There are a bunch of ways to edit files.  The only *wrong* way is to use
Microsoft Word... which, if you're not quite careful, will put non-text
characters in your file and mess everything up.  You Have Been Warned.

The simplest default editor that comes with your EC2 machine is called
'nano'; it's very similar to 'pico', the editor that pine uses.  You
can run it like this::

  %% nano $filename

where $filename is any valid UNIX filename (which is pretty much anything).
It's a *really* good idea to avoid spaces and funny characters -- I'd
suggest sticking with lowercase, underscores and dashes, and periods, e.g. ::

  thats_some-filename-there.joe.txt

Note, if you make up a long filename, you don't always have to type the
whole thing out -- you can type 'that' and then hit TAB to do auto-completion.

Once nano is running, you can type stuff into it and move around with
the arrow keys.  (The mouse won't work, sorry.  That's attached to
your local computer, which doesn't send mouse information to the
remote computer -- UNIX was invented before mice.)  Along the bottom of the
screen, though, are some cryptic instructions: ::

  ^G Get Help  ^O WriteOut  ^R Read File ^Y Prev Page ^K Cut Text  ^C Cur Pos
  ^X Exit      ^J Justify   ^W Where Is  ^V Next Page ^U UnCut Text^T To Spell

These are all actions that nano will perform for you on command.
The critical piece of information that you are lacking is this: the ^ means
"use the control key", i.e. "CTRL-X" exits.  Try typing something, then
hitting "CTRL-X".  It will ask you if you REALLY want to save... says "yes".
And now try re-editing the file with nano -- you can use the up arrow at
the '%' prompt to get to the previous command.  Easy, yeh?

And that's it, you're done!  You've edited your first text file!

Note that what you put *in* the text file will vary with what you're
trying to do.  More on that later.
