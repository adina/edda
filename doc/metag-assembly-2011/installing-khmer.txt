Installing khmer
================

khmer is a toolkit that we have been building here at MSU.  It contains
a bunch of scripts and libraries that are of varying utility.  Below,
we'll install it on our EC2 machine for later use.

Change to the working disk::

  %% cd /mnt

Install some Python tools::

  %% curl -O http://python-distribute.org/distribute_setup.py
  %% python distribute_setup.py
  %% easy_install nose

Install a copy of our sequence IO library, screed::

  %% git clone git://github.com/ctb/screed.git
  %% cd screed
  %% python setup.py install
  %% cd ..

Install a copy of khmer, our assembly tools library::

  %% git clone git://github.com/ctb/khmer.git -b refactor
  %% cd khmer
  %% make test

Make sure we can run it from our /mnt directory::

  %% echo export PYTHONPATH=/mnt/khmer/python >> /root/.bashrc
  %% export PYTHONPATH=/mnt/khmer/python >> /root/.bashrc

Test::

  %% python
  >>> import khmer

(make sure there's no error!)

now exit Python::

  >>> exit()
